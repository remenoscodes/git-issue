.SH NAME
git\-issue\-merge \- merge issues from a remote
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B git issue merge
.I <remote>
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fetch and merge issues from a remote repository.
Issues are fetched into a staging namespace under
.BI refs/remotes/ <remote> /issues/
and then merged into local
.BR refs/issues/ .
.PP
Three merge outcomes are possible:
.IP \(bu 2
.B New issue:
the remote has an issue not present locally.
The ref is created locally.
.IP \(bu 2
.B Fast-forward:
the local ref is an ancestor of the remote.
The local ref is updated.
.IP \(bu 2
.B Diverged:
both sides have new commits.
A merge commit with two parents is created, resolving metadata
using field-specific strategies (last-writer-wins for scalars,
three-way set merge for labels).
.PP
Remote tracking refs are cleaned up after a successful merge unless
.B \-\-check
is used.
.SH OPTIONS
